## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the **Home Watering Station Server**. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli.

### 1.2 Project scope

This software system will be a "Home Watering Station Server" for home use with the possibility of scaling and further integration into a small agricultural production. This system will be designed to minimize plant care time by providing tools to help automate the watering process, collect ecosystem information and resource consumption, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. By maximizing the efficiency and productivity of process automation, the system will meet user needs while remaining easy to understand and use.

More specifically, this system is designed to allow the user to control a group of equipment such as water pumps, a group of temperature and humidity display sensors ect. to automate the plant growing process. The software will facilitate communication between client mobile or destop app and equipment.

### 1.5 Document Overview

The next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.

The third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product.

Both sections of the document describe the same software product in its entirety, but are intended for different audiences and thus use different language.
